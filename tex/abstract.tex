With the rise of agile development methods in recent years, different software testing techniques are emerging to support the main feature of such methods: rapid feedback. Based on this, we propose in this work contextualise and discuss the use of emerging techniques for software testing, focusing on techniques Test-Driven Development, Behavior-Driven Development, Continuous Integration and Test Doubles, addressing them in a case study, adding knowledge, still scattered and diffuse, on different approaches, possibilities and open points use of such techniques, using for this project kanban-roots.
